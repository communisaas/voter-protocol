# Communiqué Integration

## Overview

VOTER Protocol integrates with Communiqué to certify civic actions and reward democratic participation. **Users open their mail client as usual. Everything else happens under the hood.**

## Integration Principles

**No wallet required initially.** Users participate immediately through deterministic address generation. Connect wallet later to claim rewards.

**Server-side security.** All VOTER Protocol communication happens server-side. No sensitive config exposed to clients.

**Seamless UX.** From the user's perspective, nothing changes. Certification happens automatically in the background.

## Environment Configuration

Add to your Communiqué `.env`:

```env
VOTER_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
VOTER_API_KEY=your_api_key
ENABLE_CERTIFICATION=true
```

## Technical Implementation

**Certification Service:** Client-safe service using server-side proxy endpoints. No sensitive configuration exposed to browsers.

**Address Generation:** Deterministic addresses created from user IDs. Same user always gets same address.

**Server Proxies:** SvelteKit API routes handle VOTER Protocol communication securely.

## Development Flow

**User sends email** → **Communiqué opens mail client** → **Server proxy certifies action** → **VOTER Protocol agents verify** → **Virtual rewards accumulate** → **User can connect wallet to claim**

## Key Features

**Deterministic addresses** from user IDs. No private keys generated or stored. Connect real wallet anytime.

**Server-side proxies** handle all VOTER Protocol communication. API keys never exposed to browsers.

**Virtual rewards** accumulate off-chain. Claim on-chain when ready.

## Database Schema Updates

User addresses, VOTER balances, reputation scores, and virtual reward tracking integrate seamlessly with existing Communiqué data models.

## Certification Flow

**Automatic certification** happens invisibly after email delivery. Multi-agent consensus verifies civic actions and calculates rewards based on impact and quality.

**Progressive decentralization** lets users start immediately with deterministic addresses, then connect wallets when ready to claim rewards on-chain.

**Quality discourse pays.** Carroll Mechanisms reward good-faith engagement and penalize bad-faith participation through reputation scoring.

## Implementation Notes

**Certification never blocks email delivery.** If VOTER Protocol is unavailable, users still send their messages successfully.

**Graceful degradation** ensures civic engagement continues even during system maintenance.

**Privacy by design** - no PII crosses blockchain boundaries. Only participation proofs and reputation scores are anchored on-chain.

## Deployment

**Development:** Both systems run independently. VOTER Protocol on :8000, Communiqué on :5173. Configure environment variables for secure communication.

**Production:** Deploy contracts to Monad first. VOTER Protocol backend to cloud infrastructure. Communiqué frontend to edge network.

## Security Architecture

**Server-side secrets.** API keys never touch client code. Proxy routes handle all sensitive communication.

**Deterministic but unpredictable.** Platform salt ensures addresses can't be guessed or reused across systems.

**Privacy by design.** No personal data crosses blockchain boundaries. Only participation proofs and reputation scores anchor on-chain.

**User sovereignty.** Connect wallets on your terms. Private keys never generated by our system.

## Fault Tolerance

**Civic engagement never fails.** If VOTER Protocol is down, emails still send. Users don't lose civic actions.

**Graceful degradation** ensures democratic participation continues during any system outage.

**Background certification** processes rewards without blocking user experience.

**The UX stays the same. The backend gets smart. Democracy pays.**
