# Documentation Cleanup Log

**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Action**: Post-brutalist audit documentation cleanup
**Context**: Removed obsolete PSE-era documentation after migration to Axiom halo2_base

---

## Files Deleted (Obsolete PSE-Era Cruft)

### 1. TEST-STATUS.md
**Deleted**: Completely obsolete PSE-stack testing report
**Reason**:
- Dated 2025-10-23 (pre-Axiom migration)
- References placeholder chip, PSE Poseidon gadget, "Week 1 complete"
- All tests have been rewritten for Axiom halo2_base
- Test suite completely changed (14 tests → 7 Poseidon tests)

**Replacement**: See `MIGRATION_NOTES.md` Phase 2 and Phase 3 results for current test status

---

### 2. OPTIMIZATION-PLAN.md
**Deleted**: Pre-brutalist audit optimization plan
**Reason**:
- Dated 2025-10-23 (before security audit)
- Focused on performance optimization without security context
- Many tasks superseded by critical security fixes
- Didn't account for Merkle path forgery vulnerability

**Replacement**: See `SECURITY_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md` Task 3.1 for performance optimization in security context

---

### 3. BRUTALIST-AUDIT.md
**Deleted**: Old brutalist audit from PSE stack era
**Reason**:
- Audit findings from October 23, 2025 (PSE stack)
- Found issues with placeholder chip, missing equality constraints, wrong constant usage
- All PSE-specific findings now irrelevant after Axiom migration
- NEW brutalist audit (from conversation) found completely different vulnerabilities

**Replacement**: See `SECURITY_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md` for current brutalist audit findings (Merkle path forgery, supply-chain attacks, circular test dependencies)

---

### 4. SYNTHESIS-ERROR-RESEARCH.md
**Deleted**: PSE-specific debugging notes
**Reason**:
- Investigated PSE halo2_poseidon synthesis errors
- Multiple chip instances hypothesis, region allocation issues
- All PSE-specific problems now moot after Axiom migration
- Axiom halo2_base uses different synthesis patterns (no synthesis errors)

**Replacement**: No replacement needed - synthesis errors resolved by Axiom migration

---

### 5. TESTING-STRATEGY.md
**Deleted**: Comprehensive but PSE-specific testing strategy
**Reason**:
- Extensive PSE-specific test patterns (MockProver with PSE circuits)
- References PSE chips, PSE Poseidon gadget configuration
- Needs complete rewrite for Axiom halo2_base patterns
- Test philosophy still valid, but implementation details obsolete

**Replacement**: Rewrite needed in future with Axiom halo2_base testing patterns (RangeCircuitBuilder, Context-based tests)

---

### 6. HASH-FUNCTION-ALTERNATIVES.md
**Deleted**: PSE-specific alternatives analysis
**Reason**:
- Analyzed alternatives to PSE Poseidon (MiMC, Rescue-Prime, halo2_base)
- Entire premise was "PSE Poseidon has synthesis errors"
- Decision already made: migrated to Axiom halo2_base Poseidon
- No longer evaluating alternatives

**Replacement**: Decision documented in `HALO2_BASE_MIGRATION_ANALYSIS.md`

---

## Files Retained (Still Relevant)

### PSE-POSEIDON-BUG-REPORT.md
**Status**: KEEP
**Reason**: Historical context explaining WHY we migrated from PSE to Axiom
**Usage**: Reference when explaining migration rationale

---

### HALO2_BASE_MIGRATION_ANALYSIS.md
**Status**: KEEP
**Reason**: Original migration plan and decision analysis
**Usage**: Reference for understanding migration strategy and tradeoffs

---

### MIGRATION_NOTES.md
**Status**: KEEP + UPDATED
**Reason**: Active tracking document for migration progress
**Updates**: Added security status section with brutalist audit findings

---

### SECURITY_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md
**Status**: KEEP (just created)
**Reason**: Comprehensive security audit findings and remediation roadmap
**Usage**: Primary reference for security fixes and timeline

## Current Documentation Truth

**For migration status**: See `MIGRATION_NOTES.md`
- Phase 1 (dependencies): ✅ COMPLETE
- Phase 2 (Poseidon): ✅ COMPLETE
- Phase 3 (Merkle): ✅ COMPLETE
- Phase 4/5 (district circuit, prover): 🔄 PENDING

**For security status**: See `SECURITY_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md`
- Status: 🔴 **NOT PRODUCTION-READY**
- Critical vulnerabilities: 3 identified (Merkle forgery, supply-chain, circular tests)
- Timeline to production: 2-3 WEEKS
- Blocker: External security audit required

**For historical context**: See `PSE-POSEIDON-BUG-REPORT.md` and `HALO2_BASE_MIGRATION_ANALYSIS.md`

## Key Takeaways from Brutalist Audit

The brutalist security audit (3 AI critics: Claude, Codex, Gemini) found that our "Phase 3 complete" status was **dangerously premature**:

### What We Thought
- ✅ Poseidon hash works (7/7 tests passing)
- ✅ Merkle tree works (7/7 tests passing)
- ✅ Ready for district circuit integration

### What Brutalists Found
- 🔴 **Merkle path forgery vulnerability** - Can prove membership in WRONG district
- 🔴 **Supply-chain attack vulnerability** - Mutable git tags enable backdoors
- 🔴 **Circular test dependency** - Tests verify library against itself
- 🔴 **No constraint verification** - Tests check witness values, not constraints
- 🔴 **Missing golden vectors** - No independent verification of Poseidon outputs

### The Reality
**We built a working implementation with catastrophic security holes.** Tests passed because they tested the wrong things. This is why we do adversarial security audits BEFORE production deployment.

**Quote from Gemini critic**:
> "This is a voting protocol. People's lives are at stake. Do not deploy this until these vulnerabilities are fixed."

## Next Steps

1. **Complete security remediation** (2-3 weeks)
   - Fix Merkle path forgery
   - Fix supply-chain vulnerability
   - Generate golden test vectors
   - Add MockProver constraint verification
   - Migrate remaining circuits with security fixes

2. **External security audit** (Trail of Bits, Zellic, or Spearbit)
   - Focus: Constraint soundness, witness tampering resistance
   - Penetration testing by adversarial prover

3. **Only then**: Production deployment

*"Better to find catastrophic bugs in development than have them exploited in production. The brutalists saved us."*
