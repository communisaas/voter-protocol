All other major King County cities (Bellevue, Kent, Renton, Federal Way, Kirkland, Auburn, Redmond, Sammamish, Burien) use at-large council election systems and do not have geographic council districts to map. Seattle is the only city in King County with district-based council elections, as noted in local reporting."}
