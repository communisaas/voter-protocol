================================================================================

⚠️  MERIDIAN, ID (FIPS: 1652120) - TRANSITIONED 2023
   Coverage: 40.0% - MAY REFLECT OUTDATED AT-LARGE DATA
   Former Structure: At-large elections (all councilmembers citywide)
   Current Structure: 6 geographic districts (since November 2023)
   Reason: Idaho law requires cities over 100,000 to use districts
   Population: 117,635 (2020 census)
   Source: https://meridiancity.org/city-council/city-council-districts/

   ACTION REQUIRED:
   - Verify registry has post-2023 district boundaries
   - If data predates 2023, it reflects old at-large structure
   - Expected: 6 districts created 2022-2023

⚠️  BIG BEAR LAKE, CA (FIPS: 0606210) - TRANSITIONED 2018

   - Verify registry has post-2022 redistricting boundaries
   - If data predates 2018, it reflects old at-large structure
   - Expected: 4-5 districts (post-2022 map)

================================================================================
KEY INSIGHTS
================================================================================

1. AT-LARGE VOTING IS RARE
   - Only 1 of 8 researched cities confirmed at-large
   - Most low-coverage cities have districts but wrong data

2. DISTRICT RESIDENCY ≠ AT-LARGE VOTING
   - Milton, GA: District residency BUT at-large voting
   - Key distinction: Do ALL voters vote for ALL seats? (Yes = at-large)

3. STATE LAWS DRIVING TRANSITIONS
   - Idaho: Cities over 100k must use districts (Meridian 2023)
   - California: CVRA pressure (Big Bear Lake 2018)

4. COMMON WRONG DATA SOURCES
   - County boundaries instead of city boundaries
   - State legislative districts instead of city council
   - Regional planning districts instead of electoral districts
   - Overlapping jurisdictions (city + county)
   - Outdated pre-transition data

================================================================================

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

1. Web search for city charters, municipal codes, official websites
2. Prioritized .gov sources over third-party sites
3. Cross-referenced multiple sources for verification
4. Documented transition dates for formerly at-large cities
5. Verified FIPS codes against Census standards

LIMITATIONS:
- Some city charters not available online (paywall/restricted)
- Transition dates may be approximate based on available sources
- Some cities have district maps but not detailed charter language online

================================================================================
STATUS: RESEARCH COMPLETE
Next Steps: Source correct district boundaries for 7 cities with wrong data
