- Enhanced error handling with the global error handler
- Comprehensive impact scoring and notification system
- Parallel agent processing for better performance

**Flow**:
1. 📧 **Webhook Trigger**: Receives civic action data
2. ⚙️ **Data Preparation**: Validates and enriches action data
3. 🔍 **Agent Verification**: Parallel verification, reward calculation, reputation update
4. ✅ **Validation Check**: Routes based on verification success
5. 💾 **Storage**: Persists certification data
6. 📊 **Aggregation**: Combines all agent results
7. 📢 **Notification**: Sends success/failure notifications

### 3. Challenge Market - Optimized (`challenge-market-optimized.json`)

**Purpose**: Implements Carroll Mechanisms for information quality markets with quadratic economics.

**Improvements**:
- Enhanced severity calculation based on multiple factors
- Multi-agent consensus for critical challenges
- Quadratic staking with reputation-based scaling
- Comprehensive outcome determination logic
- Integrated treasury fee collection

**Flow**:
1. ⚔️ **Challenge Created**: Webhook receives challenge data
2. ⚙️ **Data Preparation**: Calculates severity and risk factors
3. 🔍 **Dual Verification**: Verifies both original claim and challenge
4. 🤖 **Consensus Routing**: Critical challenges get multi-agent consensus
5. ⚖️ **Outcome Determination**: Evidence-based winner selection
6. 💰 **Quadratic Payouts**: Reputation-scaled stake distribution
7. 📊 **Finalization**: Updates reputation, stores results, sends notifications

## Sub-Workflows

### Agent Communication (`sub-workflows/agent-communication.json`)

**Purpose**: Centralized agent API communication with built-in error handling and retry logic.

**Features**:
- ✅ Automatic retry with exponential backoff

### Database Operations (`sub-workflows/database-operations.json`)

**Purpose**: Centralized database operations with connection pooling and caching.

**Supported Operations**:
- `query`: Execute SELECT queries with caching
- `insert`: Insert new records with validation
- `update`: Update existing records
- `upsert`: Insert or update on conflict
- `batch`: Batch insert/update operations
