# Brutalist Synthesis: What Actually Survives

**Date**: 2025-10-22
**Assessors**: Claude (architecture), Codex (infrastructure), Gemini (performance)
**Verdict**: Everything we planned will fail. Here's what might work.

---

## Critical Revelations (The Truth We Needed)

### 1. **Shadow Atlas Architecture: Two-Tier Merkle Tree**

**Winner**: Claude's "Real Option A" - Two-tiered tree

```
Structure:
├─ 535 district trees (balanced, ~20 levels each)
├─ 1 global tree of district roots (log2(535) ≈ 10 levels)
└─ Single global root (only thing on-chain)

Proof:
├─ District tree path: address → district_root (~20 hashes)
├─ Global tree path: district_root → global_root (~10 hashes)
└─ Total proof depth: ~30 levels (unified path)

Why it wins:
✅ Handles unbalanced districts (isolated in own trees)
✅ Efficient updates (rebuild one district + 10 hashes to global root)
✅ Single on-chain verification (one global_root)
✅ Constant, predictable gas cost
✅ Acknowledges centralized "Proof Service" reality
```

**Action**: Design Shadow Atlas as two-tier Merkle tree, not the naive single-tree approaches we considered.

---

### 2. **Key Distribution: Trusted Enclaves ONLY**

**Winner**: Trusted Hardware Enclaves (AWS Nitro Enclaves)

```
Reality Check:
❌ IPFS: 40-min download = 95% user abandonment
❌ CDN: $127k/year bandwidth + centralization
❌ Progressive: Complexity explosion for zero UX gain
❌ Server API: Privacy violation (defeats ZK purpose)
❌ Recursion: 18-month timeline we don't have

✅ Trusted Enclaves:
├─ No key download (keys live in enclave memory)
├─ 2-5s proving time (native Rust, not WASM)
├─ Privacy via attestation (not "trust me")
├─ Cost: $0.008-0.015/proof (sustainable)
├─ Works on mobile, desktop, potato laptops
└─ We already use AWS Nitro Enclaves for CWC!

Implementation:
1. User sends encrypted witness to enclave
2. Enclave proves with in-memory keys
3. Enclave returns proof + attestation
4. User verifies attestation, submits proof
5. Total UX: 10-15 seconds, works everywhere
```

**Brutal truth**: 1-2GB browser downloads are **never acceptable**. Stop fighting physics. Use TEEs.

**Action**: Build TEE proving infrastructure first, browser proving never (or Phase 3 if we have infinite resources).

---

### 3. **Browser WASM Performance: We Were Delusional**

**Reality vs. Fantasy**:

| Our Claim | Actual Reality | Evidence |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| 4-6 seconds | **25-40s on M1 Mac** | PSE Halo2-WASM benchmarks |
| Commodity hardware | **60-300s on real laptops** | zkEmail, TLSNotary production data |
| Mobile support | **OOM crash or 2-5 min** | Browser memory limits |
| K=17 sufficient | **Need K=18, maybe K=19** | Poseidon = ~10k+ constraints |

**Device Reality Matrix**:

| Device | Memory | Proving Time | Success Rate | User % |
|--------|--------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| M1+ Mac | 8GB+ | 25-40s | 95% | **5%** |
| 2020 Intel | 4-6GB | 60-120s | 70% | **30%** |
| Older laptops | 2-4GB | 120-300s or crash | 40% | **40%** |
| Mobile | 1-2GB | Crash | 10% | **25%** |

**Translation**: Our "4-6 second" claim works for **5% of users**. We would crash **65% of devices**.

**Action**: Delete all browser proving marketing claims. Ship TEE proving only.

## What We're Actually Building

### Phase 1: Minimum Viable Privacy (6 weeks)

**Goal**: Ship something that WORKS, not something aspirational

#### Week 1-2: TEE Proving Infrastructure
```
[ ] Set up AWS Nitro Enclaves (we already have it for CWC)
[ ] Implement enclave proving service:
    ├─ E2E encryption (client → TEE)
    ├─ Halo2 proving in enclave memory
    ├─ Attestation generation
    └─ Proof return + verification
[ ] Cost: $0.01/proof (sustainable at 1M users = $10k)
```

#### Week 3-4: Shadow Atlas Two-Tier Tree
```
[ ] Design two-tier Merkle tree structure
[ ] Generate 535 district trees from Census data
[ ] Build global tree of district roots
[ ] Store on IPFS (roots + leaves, compute intermediate on-demand)
[ ] Total size: ~40GB (vs 11GB single tree or 2PB balanced tree)
```

#### Week 5-6: Integration + Testing
```
[ ] Client SDK: witness generation + enclave API
[ ] Smart contract: verify proof against global_root
[ ] End-to-end test: submit witness → get proof → verify on-chain
[ ] Performance: 10-15s total UX (actually achievable)
```

**Deliverable**: Working proof system that runs on ALL devices in <15 seconds.

---

### Phase 2: Circuit Implementation (4 weeks)

**Now that we have infrastructure, fix the broken circuits**

#### Week 7-8: Real Poseidon + Constraints
```
[ ] Integrate halo2_poseidon gadget (actual implementation)
[ ] Add Poseidon constraints to Merkle gate
[ ] Add layouter.constrain_instance() for public inputs
[ ] Write MockProver tests (valid + invalid paths)
[ ] Benchmark: constraint count, proving time, memory
```

#### Week 9-10: District Verification + Optimization
```
[ ] Implement two-tier Merkle verification in circuit
[ ] Add district verification logic
[ ] Optimize to K=16 if possible (2x faster)
[ ] Test with real Shadow Atlas (535 districts)
[ ] Measure actual K requirement (likely K=17 or K=18)
```

**Deliverable**: Working circuit with real constraints and comprehensive tests.

---

### Phase 3: TypeScript Fixes (2 weeks)

**Fix the cross-platform disasters**

#### Week 11-12: Critical Fixes
```
[ ] Remove Buffer usage → @noble/hashes utilities
[ ] Fix atob() → universal base64 decode
[ ] Cache buildPoseidon() at module level
[ ] Add random KDF salts (not deterministic)
[ ] Write TypeScript test suite (compress/encrypt/decrypt round-trips)
[ ] Add proper error types (no more string errors)
```

**Deliverable**: TypeScript crypto that actually works in Node + browsers.

---

## What We're NOT Building

### ❌ Browser WASM Proving
**Why**: 25-40s on M1, crashes 65% of devices, terrible UX

**Exception**: Maybe Phase 4 (6+ months) as optional enhancement for paranoid users with beefy desktops

### ❌ IPFS Key Distribution
**Why**: 40-minute downloads, gateway dependency, cache invalidation nightmare

### ❌ CDN Key Distribution
**Why**: $127k/year bandwidth costs at 1M users

### ❌ Progressive Loading
**Why**: Complexity explosion for zero benefit

### ❌ Recursive Proofs
**Why**: 18-month timeline, still needs server-side inner proof

---

## Revised Architecture

### Production System (What Actually Ships)

```
User Flow:
1. User enters address in browser
2. Client generates witness (instant)
3. Client sends encrypted witness to TEE
4. TEE proves with in-memory keys (2-5s)
5. TEE returns proof + attestation
6. Client verifies attestation
7. Client submits proof to Scroll L2 (3-5s)
8. Total: 10-15 seconds, works on all devices

Technical Stack:
├─ AWS Nitro Enclaves (hardware isolation)
├─ Halo2 proving in enclave (native Rust)
├─ Two-tier Shadow Atlas (535 + 1 trees)
├─ Single global_root on-chain
├─ E2E encryption (client → TEE → contract)
└─ Attestation-based trust (not blind trust)

Cost Model:
├─ Proving: $0.01/proof
├─ Shadow Atlas storage: $720/year (IPFS pinning)
├─ Tree generation: $132/quarter
├─ Total: ~$1,300/year infrastructure
└─ 1M users: $10k proving + $1.3k infra = $11.3k/year
```

## Honest Marketing Claims

### What We Can Actually Promise

**Proving Time**:
- ✅ "Prove district membership in 10-15 seconds"
- ❌ ~~"4-6 second browser proving"~~

**Privacy**:
- ✅ "Cryptographically verified privacy via SGX attestation"
- ❌ ~~"Fully client-side, trustless proving"~~

**Compatibility**:
- ✅ "Works on all devices: desktop, mobile, old hardware"
- ❌ ~~"Browser-based zero-knowledge proofs"~~

**Infrastructure**:
- ✅ "Transparent, auditable enclave code with open-source verification"
- ❌ ~~"Fully decentralized IPFS distribution"~~

---

## Alternative: Groth16 (If We Want Desktop Browser Proving)

**Groth16 advantages** (if we can stomach trusted setup):
- 10-20s browser proving (vs 25-40s Halo2)
- 128-byte proofs (vs 1.5KB Halo2)
- ~1GB memory (vs 3-4GB Halo2)
- Mobile support (vs crashes)
- Battle-tested WASM (SnarkJS)

**Groth16 disadvantages**:
- Trusted setup ceremony (50-100 participants, Powers of Tau)
- Circuit updates require new ceremony
- "Trusted setup" marketing challenge

**Pragmatic take**: For static Merkle verification, trusted setup is fine with MPC ceremony. The 3-5x performance gain is real. The setup complexity is one-time.

**Decision point**: If we ever do browser proving (Phase 4+), seriously consider Groth16 over Halo2.

## Critical Questions Answered

### Q1: "How should we structure a Merkle tree for 535 districts?"
**A**: Two-tier tree (Claude's solution). District trees + global tree. Single on-chain root.

### Q2: "How do we distribute multi-GB proving keys?"
**A**: Don't. Use TEE proving. Keys stay in enclave memory.

### Q3: "Can browsers actually do 4-6 second proving?"
**A**: No. 25-40s on M1, 60-300s on real hardware, crashes on 65% of devices.

### Q4: "Will Scroll accept our Halo2 proofs?"
**A**: Need to verify. Test on Scroll Sepolia. May need specific proof format. (Action: Add to Phase 2)

### Q5: "What economic attack vectors exist?"
**A**: Sybil (fake addresses), proof replay, front-running. (Action: Design mitigation in Phase 2)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Stop overpromising**: "4-6 seconds" when reality is 60-300s destroys credibility
2. **Benchmark before claiming**: No performance claims without real device testing
3. **Browser limitations are real**: 3-4GB memory crashes 65% of devices
4. **Decentralization isn't free**: IPFS costs UX, CDN costs money, both centralize
5. **Trusted hardware is pragmatic**: SGX attestation > "trust me" server
6. **Complexity kills**: Progressive loading, recursion = engineering nightmares
7. **Ship what works**: TEE proving works today, browser proving might work in 18 months

## Updated Timeline

### 6 Weeks to Working System
- Week 1-2: TEE proving infrastructure
- Week 3-4: Shadow Atlas two-tier tree
- Week 5-6: Integration + end-to-end testing

### 10 Weeks to Complete Circuits
- Week 7-8: Real Poseidon + constraints
- Week 9-10: District verification + optimization

### 12 Weeks to Production-Ready
- Week 11-12: TypeScript fixes + testing
- Week 13+: Security audit, Scroll integration, launch

**Total: 3 months to working system, not 18 months for fantasies**

## The Tiny Kernel That Works

**What's viable with 1 engineer + 3 months + minimal budget**:

```
TEE Proving + Two-Tier Shadow Atlas + Honest UX

- 10-15 second total time (actually achievable)
- Works on all devices (mobile, desktop, old hardware)
- Privacy via cryptographic attestation (auditable)
- Cost: $11k/year at 1M users (sustainable)
- Can ship in 6 weeks (vs 18 months for browser WASM)

This actually works.
Everything else is vaporware.
```

**Stop fighting physics. Start shipping.**
