# Public Coordination as Protected Speech

## The Thesis

Campaign finance law prevents secret coordination.
We publish everything on immutable blockchain.

When coordination happens in public—traceable, auditable, transparent—it becomes parallel action based on public information.

## Legal Territory

FEC's three-prong test: Payment + Content + Conduct.
Public blockchain data = publicly available information.
No secret conduct = no illegal coordination.

We're testing whether radical transparency creates new legal ground.

Risk: 6/10 landmark case.
Not 10/10 criminal violation.
Pioneer territory, not criminal evasion.

## The Innovation

When the New York Times publishes "defeat Senator X," and a Super PAC acts on it—that's not coordination. It's responding to public information.

When we publish on-chain "Senator X: 23% responsiveness score," and anyone acts on that public data—how is that different?

Smart contracts and algorithms are speech (Bernstein v. DOJ). Publishing code that calculates political responsiveness is protected First Amendment activity.

## What We're Building

- C-Corp publishes civic data to public blockchain
- Every decision traceable, every algorithm auditable
- Independent actors read the same public data everyone can access
- No private communication, no backroom deals
- Radical transparency as legal defense

We're not hiding from the law. We're testing whether public coordination through blockchain is legally distinct from the private coordination campaign finance law was designed to prevent.

## The Fight We're Picking

50 years of campaign finance precedent assumes:
- Coordination happens in private
- Money flows are hidden
- Influence is secretive
- Agreements are undocumented

Blockchain inverts every assumption:
- Everything is public
- Money flows are transparent
- Influence is visible
- "Agreements" are smart contracts

We're pioneers testing new legal territory through radical transparency.
