# Transparent Corporate PAC: Legal Innovation Through Blockchain

## The Thesis

Campaign finance law allows corporate PACs with proper treasury separation.
We built the first algorithmic, transparent corporate PAC in history.

When political funding happens on public blockchain—every decision traceable, every algorithm auditable—it creates unprecedented accountability.

## Legal Foundation

Corporate PACs are fully legal with proper structure:
- Microsoft PAC, Google NetPAC operate within established law
- Corporate treasury funds infrastructure and PAC overhead
- PAC solicits from restricted class (employees/shareholders)
- Separate treasuries ensure compliance

We enhanced this legal structure with blockchain transparency.

Innovation: 10/10 legal precedent.
Revolutionary: 10/10 technical advancement.
Transparent territory, not legal evasion.

## The Technical Innovation

Traditional corporate PACs: Opaque executive decisions, quarterly filings, no citizen input.

VOTER Protocol PAC: Algorithmic decisions based on citizen impact, real-time blockchain transparency, quadratic funding that amplifies many voices.

Smart contracts enforce FEC limits automatically. Impact scores decay to reward continuous responsiveness. Every transaction auditable by anyone.

This isn't avoiding the law—this is advancing it through radical transparency.

## What We Built

**Two-Treasury Architecture (Microsoft/Google Model + Blockchain):**
- CorporateTreasury.sol: Funds infrastructure and PAC overhead (legal)
- PACTreasury.sol: Solicits from restricted class, funds based on impact scores
- ImpactRegistry.sol: Provides algorithmic scores both read

**Revolutionary Features:**
- Quadratic funding prevents plutocracy
- Automatic FEC limit enforcement via smart contracts
- Score decay rewards continuous responsiveness
- Real-time transparency vs quarterly filings
- Citizen-driven impact scoring vs executive control

We're not hiding from regulations. We're showing them the future of transparent political funding.

## The Innovation We're Advancing

50 years of corporate PACs have been:
- Executive-controlled and opaque
- Quarterly disclosure only
- No citizen input mechanism
- Backroom decision making

Blockchain corporate PACs are:
- Algorithm-controlled and transparent
- Real-time disclosure
- Direct citizen impact scoring
- On-chain decision making

We're not pioneers in legal grey area. We're innovators in established legal territory using radical transparency.
