## Layer Responsibilities

### Self.xyz Identity Layer: Zero-Knowledge Verification

**Purpose**: Provide cryptographic proof of citizen identity without exposing personal data

**Components:**
- **Passport Verification**: ZK proofs of government-issued passports
- **Age Verification**: Prove 18+ eligibility without revealing exact age
- **Citizenship Proof**: Verify US citizenship without exposing passport details
- **Sybil Resistance**: Each passport can only be used once across the platform
- **Keyless Wallets**: Phone number serves as wallet address for seamless UX

**Privacy Benefits:**
- Zero personal data stored on-chain or in centralized databases
- Cryptographic proofs replace traditional KYC documentation
- Government-grade document verification without document exposure
- Selective disclosure of only necessary attributes

### Monad Layer: High-Performance Execution

**Purpose**: Handle high-frequency operations requiring speed and low costs

**Components:**
- **CIVIC Token Contract**: ERC-20 governance token with staking and voting
- **Governance System**: Proposal creation, voting, and execution
- **Gamification Engine**: Leaderboards, achievements, social features
- **User Management**: Onboarding, profiles, fee discounts

**Performance Benefits:**
- 10,000 TPS for mass user interactions
- 1-second finality for immediate feedback
- <1Â¢ fees for micro-transactions
- Full EVM compatibility for existing tooling

### EigenCloud Layer: Cryptographic Verification

**Purpose**: Provide tamper-proof verification of civic actions

**Components:**
- **Civic Action Verifier (AVS)**: Custom AVS for validating civic actions
- **Congressional Message Prover**: Verify CWC delivery and authenticity
- **Identity Attestation Service**: Decentralized identity verification
- **Dispute Resolution**: Handle challenges to civic action claims

**Verification Benefits:**
- Cryptographic proof of civic action authenticity
- Decentralized verification reducing single points of failure
- Intersubjective dispute resolution for edge cases
- Cross-chain proof anchoring for maximum security

### Bridge Layer: Cross-Chain Coordination

**Purpose**: Synchronize state between Monad execution and EigenCloud verification

**Components:**
- **Verification Oracle**: Relay EigenCloud proofs to Monad contracts
- **State Synchronizer**: Maintain consistency across chains
- **Proof Aggregator**: Bundle multiple verifications for efficiency
- **Emergency Circuit Breaker**: Halt operations if verification fails

### Control Plane on Monad (cheap EVM anchoring) + Optional L2 Mirror

- **Foundation on Monad (anchoring & composability)**
  - Integrity rails: anchor registries/attestations as IPFS CIDs on Monad with minimal onâ€‘chain readable fields (status, timestamp, ids). Heavy payloads remain offâ€‘chain; batches commit with Merkle roots for amortized gas. Source: docs.monad.xyz (throughput/cost).
  - Agents remain offâ€‘chain/TEE; onâ€‘chain stores only facts required for trust and machine composability.

- **Optional ETH/L2 interop**
  - Mirror ERCâ€‘8004 registries (Identity/Validation/Reputation) on a major L2 (Base/OP) when ETHâ€‘native consumers need onâ€‘chain reads. Ensure entries are storageâ€‘backed (not eventsâ€‘only), per composability feedback in the thread.

- (optional) Validation marketplaces
  - If we require marketplaceâ€‘secured validation services, we can integrate a validation marketplace in the future. Not required for mail receipts.

Summary: we operate on Monad for cheap, EVMâ€‘native anchoring and composability; mirror minimal trust signals to an ETH L2 (ERCâ€‘8004) only when partners require it; liquidity and treasury sit on ETH/L2 (Safe), with no routine asset moves.

### ERCâ€‘8004 Interop (optional, in progress)

- Context: [ERCâ€‘8004: Trustless Agents](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-8004-trustless-agents/25098) defines onâ€‘chain Identity/Reputation/Validation registries for agent trust.
- Our approach: Monad is sourceâ€‘ofâ€‘truth for Validation (attestations). We optionally mirror Identity/Validation/Reputation to an ETH L2 ERCâ€‘8004 registry for ETHâ€‘native consumption. Ensure storage fields are onâ€‘chain readable (not eventsâ€‘only), per thread feedback.

## Technical Implementation

### Onâ€‘chain Anchoring (Monad)

- Registry (Monad): Stores template/channel CIDs and simple version graph; emits events for indexers; no PII
- Attest (Monad): Writes hash attestations for verification receipts (CWC/mail routing); supports revocations

Bridging is not routine. Treasury/liquidity remain on ETH/L2 (Safe). Mirror minimal trust signals to L2 ERCâ€‘8004 registries only when partners require onâ€‘chain reads.

## Data Flow

### Civic Action Processing

1. **User Action**: Citizen sends message through CWC integration
2. **Initial Recording**: Action recorded on Monad with "pending verification" status
3. **Verification Request**: Bridge submits action to EigenCloud AVS for verification
4. **EigenCloud Processing**: 
   - Verify CWC delivery confirmation
   - Validate citizen identity and district eligibility
   - Check for spam/gaming attempts
   - Generate cryptographic proof of verification
5. **Bridge Relay**: Verification proof relayed back to Monad
6. **Token Minting**: CIVIC tokens minted based on verified action
7. **User Notification**: Real-time notification of successful verification

### Verification Proof Structure

```typescript
interface VerificationProof {
  actionHash: bytes32;
  citizen: address;
  actionType: ActionType;
  timestamp: uint256;
  cwcDeliveryProof: {
    messageId: string;
    deliveryConfirmation: bytes;
    representativeOffice: string;
  };
  identityProof: {
    citizenId: bytes32;
    districtHash: bytes32;
    verificationTimestamp: uint256;
  };
  eigenSignature: bytes;
  blockProof: bytes;
}
```
