# Hybrid Monad + EigenCloud Architecture

## Executive Summary

The VOTER token platform is designed for a hybrid architecture combining Monad's high-performance execution with EigenCloud's verifiability infrastructure. **ERC-8004 was built for AI agents. We extend it to human civic participants.** This approach delivers both the speed needed for viral civic engagement and the cryptographic guarantees required for authentic democratic participation.

**Current Implementation Status:**
- ðŸ”§ **Monad execution layer**: Core contracts built with VOTER token, adaptive governance
- ðŸ”§ **Multi-agent verification**: AgentConsensusGateway architecture designed for civic actions
- ðŸ”§ **Cheap EVM anchoring**: Verification receipt and registry contracts ready for deployment
- ðŸ”„ **EigenCloud AVS integration**: Planned for enhanced decentralized verification

## Layer Responsibilities

### Self.xyz Identity Layer: Zero-Knowledge Verification

**Purpose**: Provide cryptographic proof of citizen identity without exposing personal data

**Components:**
- **Passport Verification**: ZK proofs of government-issued passports
- **Age Verification**: Prove 18+ eligibility without revealing exact age
- **Citizenship Proof**: Verify US citizenship without exposing passport details
- **Sybil Resistance**: Each passport can only be used once across the platform
- **Keyless Wallets**: Phone number serves as wallet address for seamless UX

**Privacy Benefits:**
- Zero personal data stored on-chain or in centralized databases
- Cryptographic proofs replace traditional KYC documentation
- Government-grade document verification without document exposure
- Selective disclosure of only necessary attributes

### Monad Layer: Cheap EVM Anchoring + Agent Optimization

**Purpose**: Handle high-frequency operations with dynamically calibrated parameters and cheap EVM anchoring

**Components:**
- **VOTER Token Contract**: ERC-20 governance token with dynamically calibrated rewards
- **Agent Governance**: Multi-agent consensus for dynamic parameter optimization
- **Carroll Mechanisms**: Challenge markets and credibility infrastructure  
- **ERC-8004 Integration**: Human-AI reputation registry mirroring

**Performance Benefits:**
- High throughput for mass civic engagement
- 1-second finality for immediate feedback
- Sub-cent fees enable micro-civic-actions
- Cheap EVM anchoring for verification receipts

### EigenCloud Layer: Cryptographic Verification

**Purpose**: Provide tamper-proof verification of civic actions

**Components:**
- **Civic Action Verifier (AVS)**: Custom AVS for validating civic actions
- **Congressional Message Prover**: Verify CWC delivery and authenticity
- **Identity Attestation Service**: Decentralized identity verification
- **Dispute Resolution**: Handle challenges to civic action claims

**Verification Benefits:**
- Cryptographic proof of civic action authenticity
- Decentralized verification reducing single points of failure
- Intersubjective dispute resolution for edge cases
- Cross-chain proof anchoring for maximum security

### Bridge Layer: Cross-Chain Coordination

**Purpose**: Synchronize state between Monad execution and EigenCloud verification

**Components:**
- **Verification Oracle**: Relay EigenCloud proofs to Monad contracts
- **State Synchronizer**: Maintain consistency across chains
- **Proof Aggregator**: Bundle multiple verifications for efficiency
- **Emergency Circuit Breaker**: Halt operations if verification fails

### Agent-Optimized Control Plane

**Monad Foundation (Cheap EVM Anchoring)**
- Integrity rails: anchor registries/attestations as IPFS CIDs on Monad with minimal onâ€‘chain readable fields
- Agent parameters: dynamic optimization within auditable bounds stored on-chain
- Heavy payloads remain offâ€‘chain; batches commit with Merkle roots for amortized gas
- Agents remain offâ€‘chain/TEE; onâ€‘chain stores only facts required for trust and composability

**ERCâ€‘8004 Human-AI Infrastructure**  
- Mirror Identity/Validation/Reputation registries to ETH L2 for cross-platform composability
- ERC-8004 serves both AI agent coordination and human civic reputation
- Storageâ€‘backed entries (not eventsâ€‘only) ensure proper onâ€‘chain reads for partners

**Economic Infrastructure**
- Liquidity and treasury remain on ETH/L2 (Safe) with no routine asset bridging
- Agent-optimized reward calculations replace hardcoded parameters
- Challenge markets and Carroll Mechanisms for quality discourse incentives

**Quality discourse pays. Bad faith costs.**

## Technical Implementation

### Onâ€‘chain Anchoring (Monad)

- Registry (Monad): Stores template/channel CIDs and simple version graph; emits events for indexers; no PII
- Attest (Monad): Writes hash attestations for verification receipts (CWC/mail routing); supports revocations

Bridging is not routine. Treasury/liquidity remain on ETH/L2 (Safe). Mirror minimal trust signals to L2 ERCâ€‘8004 registries only when partners require onâ€‘chain reads.

## Data Flow

### Civic Action Processing

1. **User Action**: Citizen sends message through CWC integration via mail client
2. **Initial Recording**: Action recorded on Monad with "pending verification" status
3. **Agent Verification**: Multi-agent consensus evaluates action authenticity and quality
4. **Agent Processing**: 
   - VerificationAgent confirms CWC delivery
   - ReputationAgent updates ERC-8004 credibility scores
   - SupplyAgent calculates performance-adjusted VOTER rewards
   - MarketAgent processes any challenge market outcomes
5. **Consensus Execution**: Agent consensus triggers on-chain parameter updates
6. **Token Minting**: VOTER tokens minted based on agent-determined amounts
7. **User Notification**: Real-time notification with credibility and reward updates

### Verification Proof Structure

```typescript
interface VerificationProof {
  actionHash: bytes32;
  citizen: address;
  actionType: ActionType;
  timestamp: uint256;
  cwcDeliveryProof: {
    messageId: string;
    deliveryConfirmation: bytes;
    representativeOffice: string;
  };
  identityProof: {
    citizenId: bytes32;
    districtHash: bytes32;
    verificationTimestamp: uint256;
  };
  eigenSignature: bytes;
  blockProof: bytes;
}
```
