# Observable Impact: What We Track vs What We Claim

## The Honest Truth About Influence

We build causal models, not just correlation tables. When template language appears verbatim in speeches, that's causation—the template caused those words. When positions shift after coordinated campaigns introducing new information, we construct the causal graph showing information flow.

Can't read minds, don't need to. Direct citations prove causation. Voting changes after mass campaigns suggest causal influence. Our funding creates additional causal pressure. Together, these form verifiable causal chains.

Democracy needs better information flows. We track causation where provable, correlation where observable, and create pressure for both.

## What Makes Impact Observable

### Direct Citations
When legislators quote template language verbatim, that's observable. A template says "This policy costs rural families $3,000 annually." A senator says those exact words in committee. We track that appearance with timestamps, context, and confidence scores.

**What we track:**
- Exact phrase matches in Congressional Record (direct causation)
- Semantic similarity scores for paraphrased content (probable influence)
- Temporal sequencing: template → campaign → citation (causal chain)
- Geographic clustering: districts with campaigns show position changes (causal evidence)

**What we can prove:**
- Templates caused specific language in speeches (verbatim matches)
- Campaigns preceded position changes (temporal causation)
- Information flow from citizens to legislators (traceable path)

### Voting Pattern Changes

Observable position evolution happens. A legislator consistently votes one way, receives thousands of coordinated messages with specific information, then votes differently. We track that pattern.

**Observable indicators:**
- Historical voting record on similar issues
- Volume and timing of constituent template messages
- Subsequent voting behavior changes
- Public statements referencing constituent input

**Confidence scoring:**
- High confidence: Position change immediately follows mass campaign with new information
- Medium confidence: Position evolves over time with consistent constituent pressure
- Low confidence: Position change has multiple potential influences

### Amendment Adoption

When citizen-proposed language appears in actual legislation, that's measurable. Templates suggest specific policy fixes. Amendments incorporate that exact language. We document the connection.

**Tracking methodology:**
- Text similarity analysis between template proposals and amendment language
- Temporal tracking from template creation to amendment introduction
- Attribution chain from template creator to legislative sponsor
- Public record of committee discussions referencing constituent input

## The ImpactAgent: Building Causal Models and Correlation Maps

The ImpactAgent builds both causal models where provable and correlation maps where observable, with transparency about confidence levels.

### Data Collection Pipeline
```
Congressional Record API → NLP Analysis → Pattern Detection → Correlation Scoring → Impact Dashboard
```

### Correlation Categories

**Strong Correlation (70-90% confidence):**
- Direct quote of template language
- Explicit reference to constituent campaign
- Voting change immediately following coordinated outreach
- Amendment using citizen-proposed text

**Moderate Correlation (40-70% confidence):**
- Paraphrased template arguments
- General reference to constituent concerns
- Gradual position evolution during sustained campaigns
- Thematic alignment with template proposals

**Weak Correlation (10-40% confidence):**
- Similar talking points without direct connection
- Position changes with multiple influencing factors
- Delayed behavioral changes after campaigns
- Indirect policy alignment

### What The Scores Mean

An 85% correlation score doesn't mean we're 85% sure we changed a mind. It means the observable evidence strongly correlates template campaigns with legislative behavior. Multiple factors always influence political decisions. We track one observable factor among many.

## Building Credibility Through Transparency

### Public Dashboard Elements
Every impact claim gets transparent documentation:
- Template text and creation date
- Usage metrics and geographic distribution
- Legislative appearances with timestamps
- Correlation scores with confidence intervals
- Alternative explanations acknowledged

### Challenge Market Verification
High-impact claims face market scrutiny:
- Challengers can dispute correlation claims
- Evidence gets evaluated by community consensus
- Winners earn credibility, losers lose stakes
- Market determines which correlations hold weight

### Methodology Documentation
We publish our correlation methodology:
- NLP models and similarity thresholds
- Temporal window definitions
- Geographic correlation parameters
- Confidence score calculations
- Known limitations and biases

## Building Causal Models of Democratic Influence

We construct causal graphs showing how information flows through democracy. Direct citations create proven causal links. Mass campaigns followed by position changes suggest causal influence we can model statistically. Our funding adds deliberate causal pressure to reinforce these patterns.

Using frameworks from causal inference, we identify the Markov blanket around legislative decisions—the minimal set of variables that screen off other influences. When template campaigns sit within that blanket, they're causally relevant to the outcome. This isn't correlation hunting; it's systematic causal analysis.

**Observable Responsiveness Metrics:**
- Frequency of citing constituent input in official statements
- Correlation between district template campaigns and representative positions
- Evolution of positions following sustained constituent education
- Engagement with citizen-proposed policy solutions

**What This Enables:**
- Citizens see which representatives actually respond to input
- Treasury funds flow to demonstrably responsive legislators
- Democracy rewards listening over ideology
- Observable feedback loops replace black-box influence

## Technical Implementation

## Honest Complexity

### What We Can't Measure
- Internal thought processes
- Private conversation influence
- Competing information sources
- Pre-existing position evolution
- Staff influence vs constituent influence

### What We Can Measure
- Public statement correlations
- Voting pattern changes
- Amendment language adoption
- Timeline correlations
- Geographic influence patterns

### Why This Matters
Perfect causation tracking is impossible in democracy. But observable correlation tracking beats the current black box of political influence. When citizens can see which information correlates with which outcomes, democracy gets more transparent.

We're not claiming to read minds. We're building observable feedback loops between citizens and legislators.

## The Bottom Line

We track what legislators do, not what they think. When template information correlates with legislative behavior, we document it transparently. When patterns emerge consistently, we act on them.

Challenge markets verify our correlation claims. Public dashboards show all evidence. Confidence scores acknowledge uncertainty. Observable impact beats claimed influence.

Democracy needs better information flows. We measure whether information actually flows by tracking what we can observe, not what we can't prove.

**We don't count messages sent. We count minds changed.**

When we say "minds changed," we mean observable position evolution—votes that flip, talking points adopted, amendments reflecting citizen input. We track the external evidence of internal shifts. The mind change shows up in the Congressional Record, not in our imagination.
