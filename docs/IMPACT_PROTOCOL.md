# Impact Protocol: What Satoshi Would Build for Democracy

Microsoft has a [PAC that spent $1.2 million in 2022](https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/). Google has NetPAC. Every Fortune 500 company has a PAC.

They're opaque, executive-controlled, backroom-driven. Quarterly filings hide decisions made in secret meetings. Citizens have zero input on how corporate political money flows.

We didn't build a better PAC. We built what makes PACs obsolete: the first protocol for direct political outcomes where citizens stake value and politicians claim transparent rewards.

## What Satoshi Would Do

Satoshi didn't ask permission to create a new economic system. We won't ask permission to create a new political one.

Bitcoin made traditional banking optional by being undeniably better—peer-to-peer value transfer without intermediaries, as outlined in [Satoshi's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). The Impact Protocol makes traditional political funding optional by being undeniably more transparent—direct rewards for responsive governance without backroom dealing.

No company. No foundation. No CEO. Just immutable code that rewards politicians for achieving what citizens actually want.

## Prize Economics: Pure and Simple

Traditional political funding funnels money through PACs that maybe influence campaigns that might affect policy. The Impact Protocol creates direct markets for policy outcomes.

Citizens earn tokens through verified civic labor—creating templates, sending messages, building democratic value. They stake those tokens on outcomes they want: "100k tokens for Austin's four-day work week ordinance." Politicians who achieve those outcomes claim the staked value as transparent, taxable income.

A city councilor passes the bike lane ordinance and claims fifty thousand dollars. A representative introduces climate legislation and claims two hundred thousand. A mayor implements the four-day work week and claims one hundred thousand.

Everything traceable. Everything auditable. Everything transparent.

## Information Creates Outcomes

Citizens create templates that appear in congressional communications; representatives cite that language in speeches and votes; position changes become observable through public records. Citizens stake tokens on the outcomes they want those positions to create.

When politicians achieve those outcomes, they claim direct rewards. Template creators who contributed get bonus payments. Democracy starts rewarding learning over ideology.

We don't count messages sent. We count minds changed. When legislators quote citizen templates verbatim, that's provable causation—those templates caused those words. When voting patterns shift after coordinated campaigns, that's observable influence we can measure and reward.

## Relentless Transparency vs Backroom Secrecy

Traditional corporate PACs operate in darkness punctuated by quarterly filings. Executive-controlled decisions. No citizen input. Secret meetings that serve boardrooms, not democracy.

The Impact Protocol publishes everything on immutable blockchain. Every staking decision visible. Every reward claim traceable. Every algorithm auditable. Radical transparency becomes our competitive advantage.

Microsoft can keep their opaque PAC with its quarterly filings. We built something that makes opacity look primitive.

## Beyond Legal Compliance

We're not dancing around regulations. We're building infrastructure so transparent that banning it requires defending corruption.

Every coordination decision gets published on public blockchain. Every reward flows through transparent smart contracts. Every politician claiming prizes does so in full public view with complete audit trails.

This tests whether public coordination—where competitors, journalists, and regulators see everything—is legally distinct from the secret coordination campaign finance law was designed to prevent.

Not legal evasion. Legal evolution.

## Five Weapons Against Plutocracy

Quadratic funding amplifies many small voices instead of whale dominance. Algorithmic decisions replace secret executive meetings with public impact scores. Smart contracts automatically enforce limits without human discretion. Score decay demands continuous responsiveness over party loyalty. Real-time transparency makes quarterly filings look archaic.

Traditional PACs hide their decision-making process until quarterly reports reveal choices made in secret meetings. The Impact Protocol makes every funding decision traceable to verifiable citizen impact in real time.

## How Minds Get Changed

Citizens create templates containing verifiable claims about policy impacts. Other citizens use those templates for coordinated outreach to representatives. Congressional offices receive thousands of messages containing identical information with sources and evidence.

Representatives start citing that information in floor speeches. Voting patterns shift based on new data. Amendment language incorporates citizen-proposed solutions. Observable position evolution gets rewarded through transparent prize claims.

Template creates information flow. Information creates position changes. Position changes create outcomes. Outcomes pay rewards. Democracy starts working.

## Microsoft vs Protocol

Traditional corporate PACs like [Microsoft's channeled 1.2 million dollars in 2022](https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/) through executive-controlled decisions with quarterly disclosure only. No citizen input. No accountability for responsiveness.

The Impact Protocol creates algorithmic rewards based on citizen impact with real-time blockchain disclosure. Politicians earn transparent income for demonstrable responsiveness. Citizens control funding through verifiable civic participation.

The first transparent reward system for political outcomes in history.

## Fifty Years vs Blockchain

Fifty years of corporate PACs: executive control with zero citizen input; quarterly disclosure hiding secret decisions; backroom dealing serving boardrooms instead of democracy; opacity as standard operating procedure.

Blockchain changes everything: algorithmic control based on measurable citizen impact; real-time disclosure where every decision lives permanently on-chain; direct scoring of representative responsiveness, not party loyalty; on-chain decision making that makes backrooms obsolete.

Innovation within legal boundaries using established corporate structures enhanced with blockchain transparency.

## Why This Matters

Democracy shouldn't flow corporate money without citizen input. Citizens create templates that directly influence reward decisions. Representatives get compensated for actual responsiveness, not party loyalty or executive preference. Backroom PAC meetings become extinct.

When every funding decision becomes traceable to citizen impact, accountability becomes automatic. Secret meetings become impossible. Hidden agendas get exposed by transparent algorithms. Open source code makes every decision auditable by anyone, anytime.

Smart contracts automatically enforce campaign finance law without human discretion. Blockchain infrastructure creates unprecedented accountability in political funding because transparency should be automatic, not optional.

## Build Don't Ask

We don't ask permission to innovate. We build tools that make the status quo obsolete.

Building something so transparent that regulators can't attack it creates innovation without fear. Revolutionizing political funding instead of avoiding it enables progress without permission. Using existing law to build the future instead of waiting for new regulations creates revolution within legal boundaries.

When traditional PACs look primitive next to algorithmic transparency, the system evolves. When citizens can trace every political dollar to verifiable impact, democracy wins.

## Live Code

Templates earn tokens. Tokens stake on outcomes. Outcomes pay politicians. Politicians respond to citizens. Citizens shape policy. Policy serves people.

The protocol exists. The smart contracts execute. The transparency operates. The incentives align.

**Quality discourse pays. Bad faith costs. Transparency wins.**
