## Critical Implementation Gaps (Brutalist Findings)

### 1. üî¥ Halo2 Circuits: Security Theater

**File**: `packages/crypto/circuits/src/poseidon_gadget.rs`

**Problem**:
```rust
pub fn hash_pair(...) -> Result<Value<Fr>, ErrorFront> {
    // TODO: Replace with actual Poseidon implementation
    Ok(Value::known(Fr::zero()))  // ALWAYS RETURNS ZERO
}
```

**Impact**:
- Every Merkle leaf hashes to zero
- Every Merkle root is zero
- Anyone can forge "valid" proofs for ANY address
- **Complete bypass of zero-knowledge guarantees**

**Fix** (Week 1: 3 days):
- Integrate `halo2_poseidon` gadget from PSE fork
- Implement real Poseidon constraints
- Write MockProver tests verifying non-zero outputs

---

### 2. üî¥ Unconstrained Public Inputs

**File**: `packages/crypto/circuits/src/district_membership.rs`

**Problem**:
- Public `merkle_root` assigned but never constrained to instance column
- Public `district_hash` assigned but never constrained to instance column
- Attacker can prove membership in tree A, claim it's for tree B

**Impact**:
- Zero-knowledge proof doesn't actually prove anything
- Can claim to be from any district regardless of actual address

**Fix** (Week 1: 2 days):
```rust
// Add these constraints:
layouter.constrain_instance(computed_root.cell(), config.instance, 0)?;
layouter.constrain_instance(district_hash.cell(), config.instance, 1)?;
```

---

### 3. üî¥ TypeScript Cross-Platform Broken

**Files**:
- `packages/crypto/src/encryption.ts:301-322` (Node Buffer in browsers)
- `packages/crypto/src/compression.ts:47-64` (browser atob() in Node)

**Problem**:
- `Buffer` doesn't exist in browsers ‚Üí ReferenceError crash
- `atob()` doesn't exist in Node ‚Üí ReferenceError crash
- Package published to npm but crashes in Node environment

**Impact**:
- Cannot use encryption in browsers
- Cannot use compression in Node
- Package is unusable in either environment

**Fix** (Week 1: 1 hour):
```typescript
// Replace Buffer with @noble/hashes utilities
import { utf8ToBytes, bytesToHex } from '@noble/hashes/utils';

// Replace atob() with universal base64 decode
import { decode as base64Decode } from 'base64-arraybuffer-es6';
```

---

### 4. üî¥ Proof Generation: Stub Only

**File**: `packages/crypto/circuits/src/district_membership.rs:190-220`

**Problem**:
```rust
pub fn generate_proof(circuit: DistrictMembershipCircuit) -> Result<Vec<u8>, String> {
    Err("Proof generation not yet implemented".to_string())
}
```

**Impact**:
- Cannot generate proofs
- WASM bindings exist but return errors
- Client SDK cannot function

**Fix** (Week 2-3: 5-6 days):
- Implement Halo2 proving key generation
- Implement proof generation with KZG commitment
- Implement proof serialization for WASM
- Benchmark: 600ms-10s target (device-dependent)

---

### 5. üî¥ Smart Contracts: NOT STARTED

**Missing**: `contracts/scroll/` directory doesn't exist

**Required Contracts** (Week 7-8: 2-3 weeks):

1. **DistrictGate.sol** - Halo2 proof verification
   - Verify zero-knowledge proofs on-chain
   - Manage Shadow Atlas Merkle root updates
   - Track nullifiers (prevent double-verification)
   - Target: 300-500k gas per verification

2. **ReputationRegistry.sol** - ERC-8004 implementation
   - Record civic actions
   - Calculate time-weighted reputation scores
   - Domain-specific reputation (healthcare, climate, etc.)

3. **CommuniqueCoreV2.sol** - Message certification
   - Certify messages with district proofs
   - Link to DistrictGate verification
   - Emit events for congressional tracking

4. **Halo2Verifier.sol** - Proof verification library
   - Auto-generated from circuit using halo2-solidity tools
   - BN254 pairing verification
   - Estimated 200-300k gas

**Status**: Zero Solidity code exists. Need Foundry setup + implementation.

---

### 6. ‚ùå Shadow Atlas: Mock Data Only

**File**: `scripts/build-shadow-atlas.ts`

**Current**: 535 districts with placeholder geometries
**Needed**: Real Census TIGER/Line shapefiles

**Required** (Week 9: 1-2 weeks):
- Download Census shapefiles: `cb_2024_us_cd119_5m.zip`
- Install shapefile processing: `shapefile`, `@turf/turf`
- Calculate bounding boxes for client-side filtering
- Store full geometries in IPFS (CID per district)
- Generate production Merkle tree (5-10MB with geometries)
- Publish to IPFS (Pinata/Infura)
- Update on-chain Shadow Atlas root via governance

---

## What Needs to Change

### Immediate (Week 1) - Fix Broken Code

1. **Poseidon hash**: Integrate `halo2_poseidon` gadget (3 days)
2. **Public input constraints**: Add `constrain_instance()` calls (2 days)
3. **TypeScript cross-platform**: Replace Buffer/atob (1 hour)
4. **Cache Poseidon**: Module-level `buildPoseidon()` cache (1 hour)
5. **Pin git dependencies**: Lock to commit hashes (1 hour)

### Critical (Week 1-3) - Core Functionality

6. **Merkle constraints**: Add Poseidon to Merkle gate (3 days)
7. **District verification**: Design + implement district logic (3 days)
8. **MockProver tests**: Comprehensive circuit testing (2 days)
9. **TypeScript tests**: Crypto package test suite (2 days)
10. **Proof generation**: Implement real Halo2 prover (5-6 days)

### Essential (Week 3-6) - Integration

11. **Proof verification**: Implement Halo2 verifier (2 days)
12. **WASM build**: Compile to browser target (2 days)
13. **Error handling**: Proper error types (1 day)
14. **Input validation**: Sanitize all inputs (2 days)
15. **Documentation**: Remove false claims (2 days)

19. **Security audit**: Professional audit (4-6 weeks)
20. **Performance benchmarks**: Document real numbers (1 week)

---

## What Needs to Be Removed

### 1. ‚ùå False Performance Claims

**Remove from ALL documentation**:
- ~~"4-6 second proving time"~~ ‚Üí Document actual: "600ms-10s (device-dependent)"
- ~~"Works on commodity hardware"~~ ‚Üí Specify: "Requires SharedArrayBuffer (95% devices)"
- ~~"90% compression ratio"~~ ‚Üí Honest: "Empty Zstd dictionary, compression varies"
- ~~"Production-ready infrastructure"~~ ‚Üí Accurate: "Experimental - NOT FOR PRODUCTION"

### 2. ‚ùå Broken Dependencies

**Remove from package.json**:
```json
// packages/client/package.json
"@axiom-crypto/halo2-js": "^0.1.94",        // 2+ years stale, never used
"@axiom-crypto/halo2-lib-js": "^0.3.4"     // 2+ years stale, never used
```

**Reason**: Axiom packages are 2+ years old (last published 2023). Using stale cryptographic packages is security anti-pattern. We're building custom Halo2 implementation using PSE fork.

### 3. ‚ùå Obsolete Code Paths

**Remove from crypto package**:
- Axiom integration attempts (never worked)
- TEE attestation code (migrated to browser-native)
- Groth16 fallback code (committed to Halo2)

**Remove from client package**:
- AWS Nitro references (fully migrated to browser-native)
- Server-side proving stubs (browser-only now)

### 4. ‚ùå Root `/src/` Directory

**Question**: Why does `/src/lib/` exist in voter-protocol root?

```
/Users/noot/Documents/voter-protocol/src/lib/
```

**Answer needed**: This appears to be legacy/duplicate code. Check if it's:
- Duplicate of packages/client/src
- Old code from before monorepo setup
- Should be removed entirely

**Action**: Audit and remove if obsolete.

### 5. ‚ùå Misleading npm Warnings

**Current**: Packages could be published in broken state

**Add to package.json**:
```json
{
  "private": true,  // DO NOT publish until tests pass
  "deprecated": "‚ö†Ô∏è EXPERIMENTAL - NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE"
}
```

## Open Questions (Need Answers)

### 1. Shadow Atlas Architecture
**Question**: How to embed district in Merkle tree?
- Option A: District-specific subtrees (535 roots)
- Option B: District ID in first N path levels
- Option C: Separate district tree + address tree

**Need**: Design decision before Week 2

### 2. Proving Key Distribution
**Question**: Keys could be 1-2GB. How to distribute?
- IPFS (decentralized, slow first load)
- CDN (fast, centralized)
- Progressive loading (download as needed)

**Need**: Strategy before Week 4

### 3. Scroll Verifier Compatibility
**Question**: Will Scroll accept PSE Halo2 proofs?
- Do we need specific proof format?
- What's actual gas cost?
- Do we need recursive proofs for batching?

**Need**: Research before Week 7

### 4. WASM Performance Reality
**Question**: Is 600ms-10s achievable?
- What circuit size can we afford?
- Do we need GPU acceleration (WebGPU)?
- Should we offer server-side fallback?

**Need**: Benchmarks by Week 4

### 5. Economic Attack Vectors (Phase 2)
**Question**: Can the system be gamed even with perfect crypto?
- Sybil attacks via fake addresses?
- Proof replay attacks?
- Front-running on-chain verification?

**Need**: Threat model before Phase 2

---

## Communication Strategy

### Internal (Team)
- Daily standup: What's broken? What did we fix?
- End-of-week demo: Show working tests
- Brutal honesty about timeline slips

### External (Users/Community)
- **DO NOT** market as "production-ready" until Week 12
- GitHub README: Add "‚ö†Ô∏è EXPERIMENTAL - NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE"
- npm packages: Mark as `"private": true` until tests pass
- Blog post (optional): "How Brutalist Testing Saved Our Crypto"

### Lessons Learned
1. **Ship tests, not TODOs** - If it has a TODO, it's not done
2. **Cross-platform from Day 1** - Test Node + browsers immediately
3. **Crypto needs adversarial thinking** - Use brutalist testing early
4. **Marketing must match reality** - "Scaffolding" ‚â† "Infrastructure"
5. **Placeholder is not implementation** - Fr::zero() is not a hash function

---

## Status: üî¥ CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED

**Honest Assessment**: We have architectural plans and scaffolding, but critical cryptographic primitives are broken. 12 weeks minimum to production-ready code.

**Next Steps**: Execute Week 1 recovery plan. No more vaporware. Just working code with tests to prove it.
